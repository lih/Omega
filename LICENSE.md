PREAMBLE
--------

The Free Beer Public License is designed to provide free (as in beer,
hence the name), unlimited access to any content for anyone who wishes
it, without restrictions such as property rights or affordability.

This license embodies the philosophy that all software (and more
generally all good ideas) is designed to solve a particular problem,
and that the only way to judge its quality is by how well it solves
that problem, rather than other unrelated criteria such as sellability
or merchandability.

All kinds of works may be licensed under the FBPL, as long as the
aforementioned works are within the legal rights of the provider to
give.
