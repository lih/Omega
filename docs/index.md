The Omega documentation
=======================

As Omega becomes more complex, I feel a stronger need to explain its
inner workings, so that others might understand (and correct) its
design. I will try to document every roadblock and feature here, and
provide a few pointers to help you get acquainted with the system.

  * the [README], explaining the basic design and purpose of Omega 
  * [Multitasking] problems and solutions encountered during implementation
  * the [Omega Syscall Reference], for writing client programs
  * A small [VGA tutorial] explaining how to setup a simple VGA driver
